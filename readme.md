# Plugin for OpenSesame for sending markers
This is an OpenSesame plugin for sending markers with Leiden University devices. 

> **Note**
> This plugin is only available for Windows. 

## Installation
These installation instructions will install the Markers plugin in the Users folder (C:\Users\\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Python\share). When different users need to use the plugin on one computer, they must all install the plugin separately.

- Make sure Git is installed.

- In OpenSesame, run from the Console:

    `!pip install --user git+https://github.com/solo-fsw/opensesame_plugin_markers`

- Restart OpenSesame. 

- The Markers items should now be visible in the Items Toolbar:

    ![markers_init](/opensesame_plugins/markers_init/markers_init_large.png)
    ![markers_send](/opensesame_plugins/markers_send/markers_send_large.png)

## How to use
Help and instructions on how to use the plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/solo-fsw/opensesame_plugin_markers/blob/main/opensesame_plugins/markers_init/markers_init.md) and in OpenSesame it can be found after inserting a markers item in your experiment by clicking on the blue questionmark in the upper right corner of the markers item tab.
